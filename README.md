# iFood Customer Segmentation Analysis (Python)

This project analyzes iFood customer demographic and behavioral data to evaluate how spending patterns and marketing campaign acceptance rates vary across demographic groups. Exploratory data analysis, visualization, and statistical testing were used to identify variables that meaningfully support customer segmentation and marketing resource allocation.

## Project Objectives
- Identify demographic factors associated with higher customer spending
- Evaluate whether campaign acceptance rates differ across demographic groups
- Provide segmentation recommendations to support more targeted marketing strategy

## Methods Used
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization
- One-way ANOVA testing
- Correlation and regression analysis

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scipy, statsmodels

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available through the iFood Data Business Analyst Test repository:  
https://github.com/nailson/ifood-data-business-analyst-test

Dataset file: `ifood_df.csv`

## Files Included
- `FinalCode.ipynb` – full Python notebook containing analysis and visualizations
